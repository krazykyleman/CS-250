My CS-250 portfolio for SNHU
 
 
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    Everyone has different ideas of how things should be done. Creating a user story helps with communication and allows the ideas to be written down so others know what needs to be done.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    Personally, I haven't heard of development methods like this in the past. So, in my brain is my own process that has been imbedded and is slowly being overwritten by these new techniques that I am learning about. I usually just start writing what needs to be done one definition at a time and then I go through, comment, and try to run and fix bugs!
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member doesn't get offended by other people's criticizem and is a team player by helping others when they need it. Grudges aren't held and open communication is practiced at all times!
